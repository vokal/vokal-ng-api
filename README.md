## <a id="section-config-usage"></a>Configuration & Usage

The `API` service returns a constructor function that can be used to instantiate a helper for an HTTP API.

```javascript
var Facebook = new API();
```

The service can be configured by setting individual properties, or by passing an optional configuration object at instantiation.

```javascript
var Facebook = new API();
Facebook.rootPath = "https://graph.facebook.com/";
Facebook.transformHumps = false;
Facebook.setKey( token );
```

```javascript
var Facebook = new API( {
    rootPath: "https://graph.facebook.com/",
    transformHumps: false,
    globalHeaders: { Authorization: token }
} );
```

You can instantiate the service on the fly for single usage, but the recommended pattern is to create a dedicated service that returns a pre-configured instance.

```javascript
angular.module( "vokal.Facebook", [ "vokal.API" ] )

.factory( "Facebook", [ "API",

    function ( API )
    {
        "use strict";

        var Facebook = new API( {
            rootPath: "https://graph.facebook.com/",
            transformHumps: false,
            globalHeaders: { Authorization: token }
        } );

        return Facebook;

    }

] );
```

The following properties can be set directly or via the constructor config object:

* [name](#prop-name)
* [globalHeaders](#prop-globalHeaders)
* [rootPath](#prop-rootPath)
* [keyName](#prop-keyName)
* [transformHumps](#prop-transformHumps)
* [cancelOnRouteChange](#prop-cancelOnRouteChange)
* [unauthorizedInterrupt](#prop-unauthorizedInterrupt)
* [loginPath](#prop-loginPath)
* [loginRoutes](#prop-loginRoutes)

Several methods are available during direct configuration:

* [extendHeaders( headers )](#method-extendHeaders)
* [setKey( key )](#method-setKey)
* [getKey()](#method-getKey)

* * *

### Properties


#### <a id="prop-name"></a>`name`

*String* | Default: `""`

A string to uniquely identify the API service.  This is useful when listening to the [events](#section-events) generated by the service, as you can check it to make sure you're listening to the correct API.  It is exposed on the `options` object sent into the Angular `$http` request, and available as `options.ngName`.

* * *

#### <a id="prop-globalHeaders"></a>`globalHeaders`

*Object* | Default: `{}`

Supplied key/value pairs will be sent as request headers on API calls.  While this property can be accessed directly, calling [extendHeaders( headers )](#method-extendHeaders) is recommended to minimize the danger of losing already-set headers (like the authorization key).

* * *

#### <a id="prop-rootPath"></a>`rootPath`

*String* | Default: `""`

All API requests will be prepended with the supplied string.

* * *

#### <a id="prop-keyName"></a>`keyName`

*String* | Default: `"Authorization"`

The name of the header field in which your API's key or token should be stored.

* * *

#### <a id="prop-transformHumps"></a>`transformHumps`

*Boolean* | Default: `true`

The request body will have its parameter names changed from camel case to underscore format before being sent, and the response body will have its parameter names changed from underscore to camel case format before arriving.

* * *

#### <a id="prop-cancelOnRouteChange"></a>`cancelOnRouteChange`

*Boolean* | Default: `false`

Enable by setting to `true`. When the application route changes, any in-progress API calls will be canceled.

* * *

#### <a id="prop-unauthorizedInterrupt"></a>`unauthorizedInterrupt`

*Boolean or Function* | Default: `false`

Enable basic functionality by setting to `true`. When a request on a non-login page returns a `401` status code, the normal error-handler events will not be fired, and the request promise will not be rejected. This allows for clean handling of the `APIRequestUnauthorized` event, which may implement a redirect to a login page or otherwise attempt to resolve an authorization error.

If a function is supplied for this value, it should be used as an attempt to resolve an authorization issue.  For example, an expired token could be exchanged for a fresh one, and re-added to the service via `setKey()`.  This function should return a promise that is resolved or rejected depending upon whether or not it was successful in resolving the authorization issue.  If resolved, the original API request will be re-run, along with any other authorization-failing API requests that had been automatically held in a queue while the resolution was being attempted.  If rejected, the `APIAuthorizationFailure` event will be broadcast, along with an optional message sent from the function.

The function will have access to the `data`, `options`, and `status` values from the initial unauthorized request, as defined in the [Promise for HTTP Alias Methods](#promise-return).  Custom `401` handling will be disabled for any requests made in this function, to prevent the possibility of infinite authorization loops.

```javascript
apiService.unauthorizedInterrupt = function ( data, options, status )
{
    var deferred = $q.defer();

    // TODO: Attempt to resolve authorization issue, then resolve() or reject() promise

    return deferred.promise;
};
```

Any re-run requests following a successful authorization resolution that still end up returning a `401` will broadcast the `APIRequestUnauthorized` event and not attempt a second resolution.

* * *

#### <a id="prop-loginPath"></a>`loginPath`

*String* | Default: `null`

Redirecting to a login page is outside of the scope of this service's intended function, but you can provide your login path to make sure that the `401`-handling functions of this service (`unauthorizedInterrupt` & `APIRequestUnauthorized`) do not activate when making requests on the login page, where a `401` is a semantically valid response to invalid credentials.

The supplied path will be compared to the value of `$location.path()`.

* * *

#### <a id="prop-loginRoutes"></a>`loginRoutes`

*String or Array* | Default: `null`

Supply a String or Array of Strings that correspond to API routes that should be excluded from the `401`-handling functions of this service (`unauthorizedInterrupt` & `APIRequestUnauthorized`).  Similarly to `loginPath`, this allows for the handling of a semantically valid `401` response to invalid login credentials.  Useful when your login mechanism isn't siloed to a single page.

The supplied route or routes will be compared to the `path` value passed into the HTTP alias method, without prepending `rootPath`.

* * *

### Methods

#### <a id="method-extendHeaders"></a>`extendHeaders( headers )`

 * `path` | *String* | the path of the request being repeated
 * `requestData` | *Object* | the body of the request being repeated
 * `promise` | *Promise* | the promise returned by the request being repeated

* * *

#### <a id="method-resetAuthResolution"></a>`resetAuthResolution()`

Resets the service's authorization-resolution state, so further requests won't be queued or re-run as part of a currently ongoing resolution attempt.  Can be called by application code in times where a resolution requires the short-circuiting of the service so application logic can take over.

* * *

### <a id="promise-return"></a>Promise for HTTP Alias Methods

Methods beginning with `$` return an [Angular promise](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q) that resolves upon completion of the API request.  The resolve/reject handlers are passed a response object with the following format:

```
{
    data:    Object  | the response from the $http request,
    options: Object  | the options that were passed into the $http request,
    status:  Number  | the HTTP status code for the completed request
}
```

The promise includes a custom `$cancel` method:

#### `$cancel( [ message, options, reject ] )`

Call to halt the HTTP request while in progress.  Unless explicitly told otherwise via `reject`, the promise for the request will remain unresolved.

1. `message` | *String* | a text message to describe the cancellation
2. `options` | *Object* | an object to describe the canceled request
3. `reject` | *Boolean* | if set to `true`, the promise will be rejected with an object with the following format:

```javascript
{
    data:    message,
    options: options
}
```

* * *
